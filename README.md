Docket for fun!

Gandalf will protect this enter. You can't come through him (and if the enter occasionally behind him, oooops, you generally don't have a chance to try)

**Presetup**

For Flow support please run 'flow-typed install && flow-typed install jest@25' (need to install flow-typed with 'yarn global add flow-typed')

Coding:
Run prettier: npx onchange '\*_/_.js' -- npx prettier --write {{changed}}. You could add husky hooks if want
